# KLIMA - Service Website

KLIMA is a modern company website designed as a demo project for a client in the air conditioning industry. While created for demonstration purposes, it incorporates some real data provided by my friends at PF Klima. I would like to extend my gratitude to them for allowing me to use atheir materials.

Built using **Next.js 15**, it leverages the latest technologies in the React 19 ecosystem. The project emphasizes performance, user-friendliness, multilingual support.

The website is hosted on the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) platform, ensuring reliability and fast content loading.
