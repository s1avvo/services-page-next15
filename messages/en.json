			"title": "Ventilation",
			"items": {
				"0": {
					"title": "What is ventilation and why is it important?",
					"description": "Ventilation is the process of exchanging air in indoor spaces, ensuring the supply of fresh air and the removal of polluted air. It is essential for maintaining a healthy and comfortable indoor environment, reducing humidity, preventing mold growth, and removing pollutants and allergens."
				},
				"1": {
					"title": "What are the types of ventilation systems?",
					"description": "• Natural ventilation: Based on the natural airflow through windows, doors, and ventilation ducts.\n• Mechanical ventilation: Systems with fans that force air circulation, e.g., exhaust ventilation, supply-exhaust ventilation with heat recovery.\n• Hybrid ventilation: A combination of natural and mechanical ventilation."
				},
				"2": {
					"title": "What is heat recovery?",
					"description": "Heat recovery is the process of capturing heat from the air being exhausted from a building and using it to warm the fresh air being supplied. It helps reduce energy loss and improves the energy efficiency of the building."
				},
				"3": {
					"title": "What are the benefits of using mechanical ventilation with heat recovery?",
					"description": "• Improved indoor air quality.\n• Reduced heating costs through heat recovery.\n• Continuous supply of fresh air.\n• Reduced humidity and risk of mold growth."
				},
				"4": {
					"title": "How often should a ventilation system be serviced?",
					"description": "Ventilation systems should be serviced at least once a year. Regular inspections and cleaning help maintain efficiency and ensure good air quality."
				},

					"title": "What filters are used in ventilation systems, and how often should they be replaced?",
					"description": "Ventilation systems use various types of filters, including basic filters (G3, G4), fine filters (F7, F9), and HEPA filters. Replacement frequency depends on the filter type and operating conditions but is typically every 3 to 6 months."
				},
				"8": {
					"title": "Does mechanical ventilation affect energy consumption?",
					"description": "Yes, mechanical ventilation uses electricity to power the fans. However, systems with heat recovery can significantly reduce heating costs by recovering heat from the exhaust air."
				},
				"9": {
					"title": "Can I install a ventilation system myself?",
					"description": "Installing a ventilation system requires specialist knowledge and skills, so it is recommended to have it done by professionals. Incorrect installation can result in ineffective system performance, excessive noise, and other issues."

					"title": "What is refrigeration?",
					"description": "Refrigeration is the process of removing heat from a specific place or substance to lower and maintain its temperature below the ambient level. It is used in various fields such as food storage, air conditioning, industrial production, and more."
				},
				"1": {
					"title": "How does a refrigeration system work?",
					"description": "A refrigeration system operates based on the refrigeration cycle, which consists of four main stages:\n1. Evaporation: The refrigerant absorbs heat from the cooled space or device, transitioning from a liquid to a gas.\n2. Compression: The gaseous refrigerant is compressed, increasing its temperature.\n3. Condensation: The hot, compressed gas passes through a condenser, releasing heat to the outside and returning to a liquid state.\n4. Expansion: The liquid refrigerant goes through an expansion valve, lowering its pressure and temperature, enabling it to evaporate again."
				},
				"2": {
					"title": "What are the types of refrigeration systems?",
					"description": "• Domestic refrigeration: Refrigerators, freezers.\n• Commercial refrigeration: Store coolers, cold rooms, food storage equipment in restaurants.\n• Industrial refrigeration: Cooling systems in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries."
				},
				"3": {
					"title": "What is a refrigerant?",
					"description": "A refrigerant is a chemical substance that circulates within the refrigeration system, absorbing and releasing heat as it changes from a liquid to a gas and back. Common refrigerants include R-134a, R-410A, R-22 (being phased out), among others."
				},
				"4": {
					"title": "How often should a refrigeration system be serviced?",
